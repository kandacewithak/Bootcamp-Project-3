A random tweet generator app

This was the first JavaScript project of the bootcamp.  We were tasked with building a responsive app using JavaScript/jQuery.  
The user is able to decide if they'd like a Tweet from a controversial or inspirational celebrity.  Based on their choice,
a personalized random Tweet will be generated for them.
